I tried so many products and I had even seen other aestheticians but I still wasn't happy with my skin. \n\nI saw the reviews here so I decided to go see Kris and she knew exactly what my skin needed. After a couple of months of using her products and getting facials, my skin was so clear! I even started getting random compliments on how good my skin looked. \n\nI went to Spain for six months and I was worried about how my skin would do without facials, but I took the products that I got from Kris with me and it kept my skin clear the whole time. Now that I'm back, I still go get facials to keep my skin extra glowey. I highly recommend coming here if your skin needs some love.",5.0,0.0003572254430250188,3.5683006867805645e-10,0.9996427742001522
1,Terrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! I hired them to pack my four bedroom home the day before the moving trucks were to arrive to move me. When I arrived home in the evening to inspect the packing I found less then half the house packed. I took photos and sent them to head office asking for a refund and an explanation. I was up until 3 am packing my house and I am now still waiting a month to hear from them regarding what they will do for me. They took the payment on my visa and I have had no refund for a job NOT DONE!! Terrible company shame on them! *the franchise owner is also an owner of 1-800-GOT-JUNK.,1.0,0.9999999896902523,1.895005534044887e-15,1.030972013515509e-08
2,"A hidden gem in a very quiet plaza. The good food, service and potion size warrants a solid 4 stars. I would definitely come back again to try more dishes. \n\nFood:\nOrdered the khinkali (georgian dumplings) with pork and beef which were large dumplings with juicy well seasoned fillings. The dumpling skin was thin with a generous sized filling that gave it a nice texture. Perfect appetizer to start. \n\nCrepes sulliko was a great choice as well. I liked it plain without the sauce so that I could fully appreciate the ground beef filling. Crepes was wrapped like a large spring roll. \n\nLamb shish kabob was delicious. The mashed potato side dish complimented it well. The creamy mash paired with the very meaty lamb kabob was a great combo. I ordered medium for kabob and it came to perfection. Tender and delicious. Don't get fooled that it's 1 kabob, portions are generous. The naan that came with it was fluffy and soft. \n\nService:\nAlthough busy, the food came out quickly and they were attentive. However, I would have liked it more if they would provide refills of water, sauce and sharp knives with the kabobs without us asking all the time.",5.0,4.044686446227321e-36,0.03333731390398773,0.9666626860959951

65,"A friend had heard amazing things about Hogtown Smoke and I had never really been to a real smokehouse before so we decided to check it out. I heard one of the big reasons to go to this place is so you can hang out on the patio. Sadly I go deaf when there is a lot of traffic outside. This restaurant is in The Beaches so we decided to stay inside where it was definitely very, very quiet.\n\nThe menu was very well organized but there was a little problem... The prices were a tad high! I know the food is cooked longer which must be more expensive but this made me have pretty high expectations for the quality of food. In other words, it had better taste as good as they are charging. \n\nThe fried pickles were pretty good. I liked that they were deep fried in a cornmeal crust. It gave them some additional crunch and bite. The dipping sauce was also quite good. Then our meat meal came. Chicken wings and burnt butts, apparently their specialty. Everyone loves them. \n\nThe restaurant had its own plethora of BBQ sauces to choose from for the wings. I did not like any of them. The odds of that are very low. I always need a sauce. I kept trying and trying but they all tasted kind of... funky.\n\nSpeaking of which, those burnt butts were all kinds of wrong. Just because you cook something for a long time does not make it more delicious. I have no issues with slightly carcinogenic blackened meat but this was pretty awful. Dry, off tasting, off putting... And not cheap!\n\nI could live with the not-greatness of the meal but the worst part was using the washroom down the break-neck-steep staircase in the basement. Hygienically, it is the worst washroom I have ever been to at a restaurant. It stank like a hogtown (maybe THAT is where it gets its name) and the sink did not work. It made me sick to my stomach and I wanted to get the hell out of there.\n\nI will say that the service was very pleasant and we were not rushed out of there at all. Considering the lack of people in the restaurant though... The only reason why I am giving this restaurant any wooden spoon is because of the service and the deep fried pickles. The people were nice but I am sorry, for that price the quality and flavour of the food were terrible and the pigsty in the basement unforgivable. I will not be back and have actually warned family and friends to stay away.\n\nI give this foodie experience one of out five wooden spoons.

81,"Let our story be a cautionary tale so you can avoid this place and its incompetence and lack of compassion.  \n\nWe brought in our 7 month old Golden Retriever puppy who has had chronic digestive issues since he came home at 8 weeks.  After diet changes, food allergy tests and numerous visits to our Western Medicine vet, we decided it was time to turn to Holistic medicine to help our little guy.  \n\nEnter, Natural Care Institute and Dr. Nancy Brandt.  We don't mind paying for quality medical care and didn't flinch at the initial consultation fee which was to provide an hour.  (It was more like 40 minutes)  Of note was that the vet never interacted with either of our dogs in a personal way.  I know she's very very busy as she kept telling us, but it was clear she wasn't invested in our session with her or our dogs.  We decided to bring a stool sample with us, which was a good thing as they would have required one.  It would seem like common sense that after having us fill out the extensive paperwork a week prior that the staff would have asked us to bring in a stool sample.  With very little information the Dr. made her diagnosis of Leaky Gut and proceeded to prescribe a bunch of medications at EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH markups.  When you can procure the same products online at 1\/10th the price I would call that GOUGING.  Knowing this we still wanted to proceed if it was going to be helpful to our puppy.  \nA few days later we received a call from the Dr.'s office saying that our dog had tested positive for Coccidia (a highly contagious parasite).  The staff member that called us couldn't even pronounce it properly, much less inform us of the dangers this parasite could cause to our pup and all other dogs he came in contact with.  We repeatedly asked to talk with the Dr., but of course she was too busy.  We checked with other vets, dog trainers, and canine experts who all were shocked that they didn't tell us to quarantine our dogs, sterilize all areas they had been in, etc.  All they could do was tell us to come down and pick up some Alban medication, but the staff couldn't answer any of our questions.  \n\nFast forward a few days...Some friends who had invited us to a puppy pool party had four dogs, (all of whom had direct contact with ours) and some started to exhibit disturbing symptoms and one had to be be hospitalized with severe vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite and lethargy.  Diagnosis:  Coccidia.  Then, our other dog started to exhibit symptoms.  When I called Dr. Brandt to ask what to do I was informed that she would be unavailable that day and that they could not tell me what day I could expect a return call.  Coccidia, if not treated quickly, can be a very serious condition.  Needless to say, I was appalled that this so called veterinarian cared so very little for the well being of their own patients.  \n\nThe bottom line is that all of this could have been avoided if the vet had been competent and had properly advised us.  Clearly this Dr is only in business for the sole purpose of making money and obviously doesn't care about the health and wellbeing of our precious pets.  \n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID",1.0,1.0,1.7753318954375318e-57,7.869330195383118e-20

They kept me in the office for about 3 hours, then told me I needed to have a blood sugar monitor attached to my arm for a week to keep tabs of the levels. All this time was spent with the PA, Leanna Peterson.\nThe Dr. came in for about 2 minutes at that appointment.\nI then had to come back about a week later to get the monitor removed from my arm - another 3 hours in the office. They wanted more follow ups, but by this time I figured out that the office appears to be more interests in tests to generate bills that are NOT covered by insurance.\nI ended up with bills topping $600 and paid them as I did not want my credit to be ruined by this office - beware!!",1.0,1.0,1.268166927882891e-18,3.566206220550908e-14
84,"I have been wanting to try this place and it did not disappoint. I ordered a margherita and a pepperoni to go. When I called they were going to be so quick that I actually asked them to push it back. It smelled heavenly inside. Pizzas were amazing, slight char and great taste.

86,"Great food aside, I really want to make a shout out to everyone working today at around 1:00 pm because if someone who works all day on their feet runs out to stop you in your car before you leave the parking lot just to give you the fries you forgot, they really need some credit for that. That was just amazing, over and beyond service! Especially when I could tell everyone was already stretched thin trying to take care of their very busy lobby, among other things. Thank you everyone!

87,"Parking is ok now that baseball is over. But the place is suddenly filthy. There was a change in management in the last two months that not been positive. The one thing this place has going for it was the nice people who worked at this location. I only recognize one person (and he's still nice) but everyone else is new.  Pictures of the dirty machines are attached. Hair, dust, sweat accumulating for weeks. Lifetime can't open soon enough!",1.0,0.9997146107725041,6.314480570213694e-06,0.00027907474692803535

89,"Great for a quick stop for a pre-made slice of pizza, New York-style.  You choose your toppings, they fix up your slice or slices and then reheat until it is hot.  If you only like fresh, out-of-the-oven, burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth pizza, this is not your place. You can get fresh out of the oven whole pizzas that are quite tasty.  We eat here a lot because the 2 of us don't need a whole pizza and my husband will not eat leftover pizza the next day.  Combos are reasonably priced for a slice or 2 with salad or wings and a drink\n\nLunch is thier busiest time at this location. Sometimes the service is spotty and they always seem to be training a new employee on the register during the busier times in the evening. Once you get your order in properly, you can expect it to come out in a short amount of time. We had dreadful service one night and the manager called us personally and gave us a credit on the register to come back and eat.

90,As soon as we got there we got amazing service! Staff was super nice and everyone looked like they were happy to be there which is unusual to see with some restaurants.  My husband and I ordered the brisket plate and had the option to do it moist or dry and we both chose moist.  The plate automatically comes with cornbread which isn't the best thing I've ever had.  The cornbread was different by having actually pieces of corn inside but it was so dry.  You can definitely taste the smoked flavor in the brisket but it was a bit bland so you can add whatever BBQ sauce you'd please.  I loved the KC sauce because it had nice spicy kick to it.  I didn't care much for the other 5 sauces but that is my own preference.  I honestly don't think the pricing was too bad compared to what I would usually spend on a BBQ dinner down south.  Will definitely try this place again to see how consistent their food is since they just opened recently.,5.0,2.574602132371342e-17,0.00037561520273173075,0.9996243847973173
91,We've been here b4 with no major problems but today was horrible! Everywhere had a wait this morning.. Now i know why Fran's didnt. Hardly anyone there yet we waited almost 15 minutes to have our order taken.. From that point on nothing but bad service the waitress acting so busy hardly doing anything and once the food finally arrived it was a total mess and just completely tasteless? Mess up bacon n eggs really???? Won't b back here.. Next time we'll b waiting somewhere for great food!

93,"I have been coming here for years and this place is great. No, they did not try and rip me off on numerous occasions. For example, my heat pan was falling and while they could have said I needed another or charge me for other things it cost me $20 to remove it. On another occasion I wanted my anti-theft removed because it was causing problems with starting the car but the company was out of business so they tried for hours and contacted other companies because it was difficult to find - they charged me nothing because they did not fix the problem! It was later discovered and removed while doing a scheduled maintenance. Moreover, I used to take my car to a dealer and it would cost me over $200 every time. I moved to Verdun and it cost me $89 - WOW, now that is a surprise!!",1.0,0.9999980671163862,8.944421081283196e-15,1.932883582130092e-06

96,"We hired Taco Naco to cater our family party after my daughter's baptism.  Another caterer backed out last minute, and we only had a couple of days' notice. Victor was very nice and got back to us very quickly. His quote was competitive, but it also included additional items that other taco vendors did not (like grilled veggies, which were excellent). We were running a little late from the baptism, but Victor was patient and waited an extra 20 minutes for us. \n\nThe food was excellent! The chicken, steak and pork were all very tasty. The guacamole was fresh and not from paste. We ordered a lot of food and had leftovers, but the guac was completely gone. I should have ordered double! :) \n\nHighly recommended.",5.0,2.609464723123281e-09,3.8597576976438654e-08,0.999999958792956
97,"Having just come back from Hawaii a few months ago, I was craving for Hawaiian pancakes and decided to go to this Las Vegas location.\n\nYou definitely get the island vibes here, nice warm smiles from the workers and simple Hawaiian decor indoor.\n\nI ordered the loco moco and as a surprise they offered a free stack of their guava chiffon pancake.\n\n**PROs:  definitely great for the pancakes, the portions are pretty big and filling.  \n\n**CONs:  the loco moco was not so flavorful, and a bit bland.  Same with the macaroni salad, a little on the bland side, and I am not much of a salty food eater. Even if you do add salt on the side, it was not flavorful as I hoped. Nothing comparable to Hawaii's loco moco.  I don't recommend it. \n\nNonetheless, I might come back some time to try their other pancake flavors!",5.0,8.348854156699635e-18,0.22122773400882545,0.778772265991153
